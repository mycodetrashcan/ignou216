Project for IGNOU MCS216



- ## HOW TO RUN THE FILES INSTRUCTIONS FOR VIEWERS
   - git clone the repository if you are familiar with github
    - if not just click the files copy the contents create a project folder create same files inside that folder paste the contents in
    - 3 files should be there index.html , script.js , styles.css inside the same folder
 
    - Now just right click the index.html file copy the absolute path (something like this - C://something/desktop/project/...)
    - paste the path into your browser this will most probably work if you follow the instructions clearly and correctly.
